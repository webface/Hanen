Additionally, standards and practices in medicine change as new data become available and the individual medical professional should consult a variety of sources in making clinical decisions for individual patients. For this reason, only the most current release of Clinical Essentials educational materials should be consulted when information is sought. New updates are issued periodically; do not rely on older versions.<br /><br />\n \nWhile every effort is made to ensure drug doses and other quantities are presented accurately, readers are advised that new methods and techniques involving drug usage described within this resource should only be followed in conjunction with the drug manufacturer\'s own published literature. When prescribing medications, the user is advised to check the product information sheet accompanying each drug to verify conditions of use and identify any changes in dosage schedule or contraindications, particularly if the agent to be administered is new, infrequently used or has a narrow therapeutic range. It is the responsibility of the treating physician or other health care professional, relying on independent experience and knowledge of the patient, to determine drug dosages and the best treatment for the patient. This is particularly serious if the agent to be administered or the treatment chosen is a new one or one that is infrequently used. Because of the uniqueness of each patient and the need to take into account a number of concurrent considerations, the information contained in Clinical Essentials should be used by licensed physicians and other licensed health care providers only as a general guide to determining the best treatment for each patient.<br /><br />\n \nThe Clinical Essentials educational programs describe basic principles of diagnosis and therapy. The information provided is no substitute for individual patient assessment based upon the licensed healthcare provider\'s examination of each patient and consideration of laboratory data and other factors unique to the patient. The Clinical Essentials educational program should be used as a tool to help the user reach diagnostic and treatment decisions, bearing in mind that individual and unique circumstances may lead the user to reach decisions not presented in the Clinical Essentials educational programs.<br /><br />\n\n<b>NO WARRANTY.</b> NEITHER CampSpirit, LLC, NOR Target Directories Corp, NOR CampHealth USA, LLC, NOR Dr. Christopher Crean, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY, PERSON, OR PROFESSIONAL MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED MATERIALS, WHICH ARE LICENSED \"AS IS\".

If I become aware of an employee or volunteer who may have violated these terms, (e.g., posting a module on a personal website or a commercial site such as YouTube) then I agree: (a) to immediately direct that employee or volunteer to summarily remove the module; and (b) to immediately notify Target Directories and CampSpirit of that wrongful conduct along with the name and address of that employee or volunteer.  I understand that this material is copyrighted and that copyright infringements may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I understand that although these modules cover material outlined in certain accreditation standards, such as those provided by the American Camp Association or the Ontario Camp Association, viewing these modules does not constitute compliance with any particular standard.  I understand that these modules, and the quizzes, handouts, and discussion questions that accompany them, are intended to help camps meet their educational goals and that it is a camp director’s sole responsibility to ensure compliance with any and all applicable laws and standards.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I understand that although the content of some video training modules may discuss abnormal or problematic thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, as well as some forms of psychopathology, there is no expressed or implied psychotherapeutic or other treatment relationship between my camp and its employees, volunteers, and patrons / campers and the owners, employees, and volunteers of Target Directories Corporation and CampSpirit, LLC.  These relationships are best described as educational.  I understand that medical or psychological questions I may have about my employees, volunteers, or patrons / campers are best answered in consultation with a licensed health care professional.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Although the video training modules and associated print materials are designed to maximize the resources and well-being of an organization’s employees, volunteers, and patrons / campers, neither Target Directories Inc. nor CampSpirit, LLC is a guarantor of results.  Neither Target Directories Inc. nor CampSpirit, LLC, or any of its owners, employees, or volunteers, may be held liable for any camper’s or staff member’s illnesses, injuries, accidents, mental health problems, behavior problems, or lapses in judgment that may occur during or after viewing these video training modules and associated quizzes and print materials.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I understand that it is my responsibility to preview all of these works (e.g., video training modules, quizzes, and handouts) in order to familiarize myself with the content.  In places where my organization’s policies or procedures differ in important ways from what is recommended in the works, I understand that it is my responsibility to educate my employees and volunteers about these differences and instruct them in my organization’s policies and procedures.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Our team is so confident that you’ll love training your staff with EOT that we guarantee your satisfaction. If you have any questions or need customer support after activating your subscription, simply contact our team toll-free (877) 237-3931, M-F during the hours of 9am to 5pm EST. We promise to do everything we can to answer your questions and get you up and running. We will also help you strategize the best ways to get the most out of your subscription.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Because activating your subscription instantly gives you full access to our digital content, we cannot refund your subscription fee after activation. However, we are happy to roll over any unused staff accounts when you renew your subscription. For example, if you purchased 100 staff accounts in 2014 but used only 95 staff accounts, we will credit your 2015 account with 5 staff accounts. Note that unused staff accounts can only be rolled over to your own EOT subscription and only when you renew for the following year. Unused staff accounts are not transferable to other organizations.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n','By clicking \"I ACCEPT\" below, I agree to the following:\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"terms\">\r\n  <li>\r\n    I understand that these works (video training modules, quizzes, and related print materials) are intended for my educational use only.  During the calendar year of my organization or camp’s subscription, I may view these materials on my personal computer an unlimited number of times.  Other use, sale, or distribution is strictly forbidden.  For example, I may not copy or post modules to a personal website, social networking site (e.g., Facebook), or commercial site (e.g., YouTube).\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    I understand that I may download the video training modules to a mobile Windows device via my desktop or laptop computer.  This practice will provide a way for me to engage in ongoing training throughout the season.  In most cases, digital rights management of videos automatically renders them unplayable at the termination of the subscription period.  If this function fails, I agree that when the season is over (on or before December 31st of the calendar year of my organization or camp’s subscription), I will delete these modules from my computer and any mobile device on which copies of the video training modules exist.\r\n  </li>\r\n\r\n  <li>\r\n    I understand that any copying and/or posting and/or unauthorized use, sale, or distribution of these works is a violation of the law.  I further understand that these works are copyrighted and that copyright infringements may be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\r\n  </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n',199.00,'LE_SP_PRP');
