	<p>Dear %%first_name%%,</p>

	<p>Congratulations! Providing <b>Prep4Camp</b> to all of camp families—especially the new camper families—will reduce the intensity of new campers’ homesickness, lower parents’ anxiety, and make staff members’ jobs much easier. Imagine getting fewer calls from worried parents… That alone makes Prep4Camp a smart investment.

	<p><b>Prep4Camp</b> includes a 25-minute video that families watch together, an audio podcast for parents to listen to (on the way home from opening-day drop-off), and a PDF tip sheet for kids to download, print, and bring to camp. Together, these tools have been shown to lower the intensity of first-year campers’ homesickness by 50%, on average.</p>

	<p>How will you know families are using Prep4Camp? That’s easy. From your Director Dashboard, you’ll be able to see the names and emails of the families who have logged in. If you want, you can wait a week or two and then email any families who have not yet accessed Prep4Camp.</p>
